Contact App

"This is a contact app built with React.js, Material UI, and a REST API using Firebase for storage. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete contacts and has a simple interface with a list of contacts and a form for adding new ones. The app makes HTTP requests to the API to retrieve and modify data stored in the Firebase database. The user can view, update, or delete a contact by clicking on it in the list and using the form or delete button."
